the numpy package is mandatory for compiling MadGraph's python-wrapper ME^2 libs.
the python version shipped with rootcore is insufficient for compiling this package.
you need to get numpy and compile it with another, similar python version (see init.sh).
after compilation, this other version is not needed anymore and we can work as usual.

preparation (in this dir):
  * source init.sh ## use one time only

setuptools
  * go to: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
  * wget the last version
  * tar -zxv setuptools-XX.YY.ZZ.tar.gz
  * cd setuptools-XX.YY.ZZ/
  * python setup.py install --prefix=$PWD/../installed
  * it will complain about '../local/installed/lib/python2.7/site-packages' not being inside PYTHONPATH, so add it as in: 
    mkdir -p ../installed/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/../installed/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
    export PATH=$PWD/../installed/bin:$PATH
  * cd .. [!!! IMPORTANT !!!]
    
install pip
  * easy_insta!ll --prefix=$PWD/installed pip

install numpy
  * pip install numpy --prefix=$HOME/local/installed

to use after installation
  * source setup.sh
